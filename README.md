Hi im @frwd27 and i am intrested in becoming a game designer. I have just recently started to make my own game and i would love if anyone coud give me tips or advice of things that would be helpful.
I am completely new to coding and will need all the help i can get. If anyone does have any advise for me please message me either on here or on my redit which is @frwd_0. 

I am intrested in many games such as overwatch and terraria and will hopeflly one day be designing a game of my own with a team.
Thank you for reading.
